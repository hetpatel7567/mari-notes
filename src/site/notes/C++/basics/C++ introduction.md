## Applications of C++
- Operating Systems & Systems Programming. e.g. __Linux-based OS (Ubuntu etc.)__
- Browsers __(Chrome & Firefox)__
- Graphics & Game engines __(Photoshop, Blender, Unreal-Engine)__
- Database Engines __(MySQL, MongoDB, Redis etc.)__
- Cloud/Distributed Systems

## Advantages of C++:
- Fast Performance
- Object-Oriented Programming
- Standard Template Library (STL) ^[The STL provides a wide range of algorithms and data structures for working with data, making it easier to write efficient and effective code.]
- Machine Independent! ^[C++ is not tied to any hardware or processor.]
- Large Community

## Disadvantages Of C++:
- Steep Learning Curve
- challenging to learn
- Verbose Syntax ^[which can make code longer and more difficult to read and maintain.]
- Error-Prone ^[ C++ provides low-level access to system resources, which can lead to subtle errors that are difficult to detect and fix.]
